## Motivation
Keyword arguments allow caller to specify argument name with values so that the caller does not need to remember order of parameters. 
Boolean type- True/ False 
## Problem Description
Write a Python function that asks the user for a boolean value residing in variable `x`.
Your goal is to check whether the variable is "true"-return "SHUTDOWN" Else "SHUTDOWN ABORTED" sorted in variable `data`.
If user enters any other value, the program must display an appropriate message. 
Create an  object  `result` which performs function call to return data. 
Print the data.

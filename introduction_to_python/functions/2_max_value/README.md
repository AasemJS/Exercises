# Max Value

## Motivation
In Python every variable name is a reference. When we pass a variable to a function, a new reference to the object is created. 

## Problem Description
Write a Python function that asks the user for 3 integer values stored in `a`, `b` ,`c` respectively. 
Your goal is to capture the 3 arguements , check whether which value is the maximum and store in data in `max_value`
Create an  object  `result` which performs function call to return data. 
Print the data.
